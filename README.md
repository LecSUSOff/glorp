Glorp combines the safety of static types with a clean, modern syntax. Its killer feature is the `watch` keyword, allowing you to build reactive, event-driven applications with zero boilerplate.

### Core Features

-   ‚úÖ **Simple & Clean Syntax:** Write readable code, free from clutter.
-   üîí **Dynamic Typing:** Write how you want.
-   ‚ú® **Built-in Reactivity:** Use `watch` to create code that magically responds to data changes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Get up and running in less than a minute.

#### 1. Download

Grab the latest `glorp` executable from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/LecSUSOff/glorp/releases) page.

#### 2. Install

Place the downloaded file in a directory and add it to your system's `PATH`. This allows you to run `glorp` from anywhere.

#### 3. Verify

Open a new terminal and check that it's working:
```bash
glorp --version
```

## Hello, Glorp!

Let's write your first program.

**Create `main.glorp`:**
```glorp
// The Main function is the entry point of your program
fn Null Main() {
    out("Hello, World!")
}
```

**Run it:**
```bash
glorp main.glorp
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
```

## ‚ú® The Power of `watch`

This is where Glorp truly shines. The `watch` keyword lets you execute code whenever a variable's value changes.

**Create `counter.glorp`:**
```glorp
fn Main() {
    // This block will run automatically every time 'counter' is updated
    watch counter = 0 {
        out("Counter changed to: ", counter, "\n")
    }

    out("Starting...\n")

    // The 'watch' block triggers on each of these lines
    var counter.value = 1
    var counter.value = 2
    var counter.value = 3

    out("Finished!\n")
}
```

**Run it:**
```bash
glorp counter.glorp
```

**Output:**
```
Starting...
Counter changed to: 1
Counter changed to: 2
Counter changed to: 3
Finished!
```
*Notice how the reactive block was triggered automatically on each assignment. No callbacks, no boilerplate.*
