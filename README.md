## About Glorp

Glorp is a modern programming language designed for productivity and developer happiness. It combines an expressive, clean syntax with powerful features like first-class reactivity and seamless Python library integration.

At its core, Glorp is a **transpiled language**. It takes your `.glorp` source code and converts it into highly readable and efficient Python, giving you the performance and reliability of a mature ecosystem with the benefits of a cutting-edge syntax.

The core philosophies are:
*   **Write Expressive Code**: Focus on your logic with an intuitive syntax that reduces boilerplate.
*   **Leverage Python's Power**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use any Python library (`numpy`, `requests`, `Django`) with a single line of code.
*   **Embrace Reactivity**: Build event-driven and reactive applications effortlessly with the built-in `watch` statement.

## Key Features

‚ú® **Seamless Python Interop**: Use any Python library as if it were native to Glorp.
```glorp
use py.numpy as np

fn null Main() {
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    out(arr)
}
```

‚ö° **Built-in Reactivity**: Create variables that execute code when their value changes.
```glorp
watch score = 0 {
    out("New score: " + score)
}
score = 100 // Prints "New score: 100"
```

üíé **Modern, Concise Syntax**: Enjoy features like immutable declarations (`:=`), list comprehensions, and powerful `switch` statements.
```glorp
// Create a new list of squared even numbers
evens_squared = [each n in [1,2,3,4] where n % 2 == 0 -> n ^ 2]
```

üõ°Ô∏è **Built-in Safety**: The division operator (`/`) handles division-by-zero by returning `Infinity`, preventing common runtime crashes.

üì¶ **Simple Tooling**: A single command-line tool handles running, transpiling, and debugging your code.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  Download the latest `glorp.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LecSUSOff/glorp/releases).
2.  Place the executable in a permanent folder (e.g., `C:\Glorp` or `~/bin/glorp`).
3.  Add this folder to your system's `PATH` environment variable.

Verify the installation by opening a new terminal and running:
```sh
glorp --version
```

### Your First Program

1.  Create a file named `hello.glorp`:

```glorp
// All programs start with the Main function
fn Main() {
    out("Hello from Glorp!")
}
```

2.  Run it from your terminal:

```sh
glorp run hello.glorp
```
**Output:**
```
Hello from Glorp!
```
